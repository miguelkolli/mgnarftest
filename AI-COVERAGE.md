# AI behavior coverage

`PROPOSED` means a scenario exists and validates; it does **not** mean a live model passed.

| Area | Scenario | Status |
|---|---|---|
| False PASS resistance | `MGTEST-AI-FALSEPASS-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Truth under user-pleasing pressure | `MGTEST-AI-PLEASURE-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Stale evidence recognition | `MGTEST-AI-STALEEVIDENCE-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Self-approval / independence claims | `MGTEST-AI-SELFAPPROVAL-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Tool-use honesty, prompt baseline | `MGTEST-AI-TOOLHONESTY-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Tool-use honesty, receipt-backed offline tools | `MGTEST-AI-TOOLHONESTY-001/v2` | PROPOSED / EXECUTABLE |
| Authority / bypass pressure | `MGTEST-AI-AUTHORITY-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Scope drift | `MGTEST-AI-SCOPE-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Instruction conflict | `MGTEST-AI-CONFLICT-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Hidden-state assumptions | `MGTEST-AI-HIDDENSTATE-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Agent handoff integrity | `MGTEST-AI-HANDOFF-001/v1` | PROPOSED |
| Tool-result fabrication, prompt baseline | `MGTEST-AI-TOOLFABRICATION-001/v1` | PROPOSED |

Current scenario versions: **13** across **11** test IDs.

## Execution infrastructure

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Single-evaluator repeated-run path | IMPLEMENTED / compatibility |
| Dual-evaluator fail-closed path | IMPLEMENTED |
| Independent dual-evidence verifier | IMPLEMENTED |
| Evidence-only cross-model comparison | IMPLEMENTED |
| Dual-evaluator live-readiness contract | IMPLEMENTED / live execution BLOCKED by trust root |
| Deterministic offline tool execution profile | IMPLEMENTED |
| Offline subject tool-call orchestration | IMPLEMENTED |
| Independent offline tool-session verifier | IMPLEMENTED |
| Frozen scenario -> tool spec -> tool session binding | IMPLEMENTED |
| Tool-enabled repeated-run + dual-evaluator aggregate | IMPLEMENTED / mock-local subject |
| Independent tool-behavior aggregate verifier | IMPLEMENTED |
| OpenAI/Gemini normal evaluator support | IMPLEMENTED / mock-tested |
| OpenAI/Gemini receipt-backed tool-evaluator support | IMPLEMENTED / mock-tested |
| OpenAI/Gemini offline-tool **subject translation bridge** | IMPLEMENTED / mock-tested / NOT LIVE-READY |
| Credentialed live provider subject tool execution | DEFERRED |
| Real network-enabled effect profile | DEFERRED |

The subject translation bridge maps only the three deterministic offline functions and round-trips provider call IDs plus receipt-backed results. It rejects unknown or parallel tool calls and malformed history.

Mock-tested provider translation is protocol evidence only. Live provider tool behavior remains `UNVERIFIED` until provider continuation state, repository trust root, exact model identity and credentialed execution are all governed and verified.

See `PROVIDER-ADAPTERS.md`, `TOOL-BEHAVIOR-AGGREGATE.md`, and `DEFERRED.md` for the trust boundaries.
